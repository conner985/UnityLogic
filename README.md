# UnityLogic
BDI Agents and Artifacts in Unity

Development framework based on Prolog with interoperability with Unity to write complex behaviours in a declarative way - i.e. do_this, than_this, finally_this

A guide will soon be available.

A video of the example developed using this architecture is available at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMHiZImVC3A
In the example, agents learn from one another and build their own behaviour at runtime sharing their knowledge of the world
